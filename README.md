# Project Documentation: K-Means Clustering for Car Data

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Car Clustering with K-Means  
**Date:** 21/01/2024

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to use k-means clustering to group cars based on their features. The project involved organizing a dataset of cars into distinct clusters, each representing a group of cars with similar characteristics.

## Dataset

**Source:** Kaggle

**Description:** The dataset contained information about various cars, including features such as speed, fuel efficiency, and other relevant attributes.

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Selected relevant columns for clustering.
   - Handled missing or non-numeric values.

2. **Determining Number of Clusters:**
   - Utilized the "Elbow Method" to decide on the optimal number of clusters.

3. **Applying K-Means:**
   - Utilized the k-means algorithm to group cars into clusters.
   - Adjusted and fine-tuned the model based on results.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Created scatter plots to visualize the clusters in a 2D or 3D space.
   - Added labels, colors, and centroids for clarity.

5. **Interpretation:**
   - Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster.
   - Interpreted results to understand the types of cars in each cluster.



## Results

- The project successfully grouped cars into distinct clusters based on their features.
- The scatter plots provided a visual representation of the clusters.
- Centroids were marked to represent the center of each cluster.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge:** Dealing with non-numeric values in the dataset.
  - **Solution:** Used appropriate techniques to convert or handle non-numeric values.

- **Challenge:** Determining the optimal number of clusters.
  - **Solution:** Applied the Elbow Method to identify a suitable number of clusters.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore additional clustering algorithms to compare results.
- Incorporate more features or refine existing features for improved clustering.

## Conclusion

The k-means clustering project successfully organized a dataset of cars into meaningful groups based on their features. The project demonstrated the application of the k-means algorithm for unsupervised learning and provided valuable insights into the characteristics of different types of cars.
